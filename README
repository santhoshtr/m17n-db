INSTALL

(0) Prerequisite

The make procedure requires "charmap" files.  The configure script
cheks the directory /usr/share/i18n/charmaps which usually should be
found on GNU/Linux system.

If you don't have that directory, you must get the files from the
source of glibc, and inform the configure script of the directory by
the argument "--with-charmaps=DIR".

If you have "wget", the script "./get-glibc.sh" is a convenient tool
to download the source of glibc (2.3) and extract files in a directory
where the configure script finds automatically, thus no need of
"--with-charmaps=DIR" argument.

Please note that /usr/share/i18n/charmaps may contain incomplete
GB18030.gz (e.g. /xfe/xa0.. /xfe/xfe are not mapped).  In that case,
you need the newer glibc source (glibc-2.3) by using "./get-glibc.sh".

(1) Installation from CVS working directory.

Just after you checked out or updated this package, run the script
"./bootstrap.sh", then follows (2).

(2) Installation from a tar ball.

% ./configure
% make
% make install
